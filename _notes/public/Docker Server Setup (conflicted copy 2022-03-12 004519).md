description: Configuration of a Docker server
---
After configuring my [[Server]] as written in [[Server setup]], me and my friend [Claudio](https://claudiofaoro.com 'Claudio Faoro’s personal website') figured that even if understanding [Docker](https://www.docker.com/ 'Docker official website') is boring and tricky, managing and maintaining software through it is much more simple and secure.

So one night we backed up all of my data on the server, we completely wiped it clean, and we reinstalled Ubuntu 20.04 from scratch. After doing this, we reinstalled everything through Docker.

Actually, it’s quite useless to thoroughly write and explain all of the steps to do this since there are some very well written guides which I'll link below.

- [docker-compose config files](https://github.com/claudiofaoro/my-docker-containers 'my-docker-containers by Claudio Faoro on GitHub'), a repository made by Claudio containing the docker-compose files we use to set stuff up.
