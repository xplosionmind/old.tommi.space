  <cite>Linuxplosion</cite> is my awesome workstation which I assembled in 2019 to edit Everyone. I now use for my most heavy computing tasks, such as video editing or image processing

## About

The original fundamental purpose of building <cite>Linuxplosion</cite> was editing [Everyone](/everyone 'Everyone'). Some computerphiles friends joined me in finding the best components to use, as well as in assembling the computer. In particular, a huge shout-out to my friend Giorgio, who had the patience of bearing with me during all of the assembling process.

I worked as a plumber all of August 2019 to buy it, and it has definitely been worth it. We finished assembling it the 5<sup>th</sup> of August.

Originally, the computer run Windows, but in 2020 I switched to Ubuntu. The only program which I miss is Lightroom (that runs in a <abbr title='Virtual Machine'>VM</abbr>, anyways), everything else works beautifully.\
I currently do not use *Linuxplosion* much since it is not in the house where I live and I connect to it

## Schedule

Linuxplosion is not a [[Server]], hence it should not stay switched on all of the time (also because it is so powerful that it sucks a lot of power). Nevertheless, I needed to make it magically turn on by itself at a given day of the week, so that I can [[Importing workflow|import media from my phone]]. To do so, I run [[Cron Jobs#rtcwake|this Cron Job]].

## Cheat sheet

This Cheat sheet is not in the same location as [[Cheat sheets|the main one]], since Ubuntu commands may be somewhat different, and I do not use them often.

<br>

### mounting a disk

```sh
udisksctl mount -b /dev/sda2
```

### remove user password

```sh
sudo visudo
```

in order not to be prompted for the password the file which opens up add the following line:
```
ernesto ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

where `ernesto` should be the name of your user.

to subsequently delete the password, run:
```sh
sudo passwd -d `whoami`
```
