It is my intention to write my thesis in [[LaTeX]], by using [[Pandoc]] as my main conversion tool. I am noting here my process of defining my workflow.

```sh
pandoc -s in.md --citeproc -o out.pdf
```

- `-s` parses the output in one standalone file
- [`--citeproc`](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--citeproc '--citeproc in PanDoc’s User Manual') activates citations, references and bibliography processing
- add [`--bibliography`](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--bibliography '--bibliography in PanDoc’s User Manual') in the case a `bibliography` field is not present in YAML metadata for the document
- add [`--toc`](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--toc '--toc in PanDoc’s User Manual') in the case a Table of Contents is intended to be added and a `toc` boolean (`toc: true`) is not present in YAML metadata for the document
