I cannot draw.

This is the most important skill I lack, since it is the only limit from the full capability of expressing and representing literally anything.

Pictures have a great effectiveness, and drawing ideas I cannot shoot photo of becomes of crucial relevance, specially when I have no words for what I mean.
