What I am doing right now:

## Studying

I am living in [Venice](https://www.comune.venezia.it/ 'Venice institutional website'), Italy, where I am attending [Philosophy, International Studies and Economics](https://unive.it/pise 'PISE course page on UniVe website') at [Ca’ Foscari University](https://unive.it 'Ca’ Foscari University website').

Specifically, my upcoming exams:

## Projects, ideas, and collaborations

In the meanwhile, I am continuing to wander around Italy to take part and/or assist to interesting things that happen. I take note of the most important stuff [here](/stuff 'Stuff - tommi.space'), and <a href='/tutto' hreflang='it' target='_blank' title='Tutto quello che ho fatto'>here</a> I log everything (literally anything) I have done.
