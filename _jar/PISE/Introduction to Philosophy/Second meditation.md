## 1. Searching for an Archimedean point

Proof of the principle of no contradiction, Aristoteles demonstrates that whoever wants to confute the principle of non-contradiction must accept the principle, because it's the basis of any argument.

The deceiving God, which is an argument against the existence of other entities, is instead an argument **in support** of the existence of the self. It's impossible to be deceived if not existing, no argument can question existence.

### Elenchtic demonstration

From the Greek _Elenchos_

It's impossible to be deceived if not existing: the argument of the deceiving God, instead of questioning an individual existence, proof one's existence.

> We can… demonstrate negatively even that this view is impossible, if our opponent will only say something; and if he says nothing, it is absurd to seek to give an account of our views to one who cannot give an account of anything, in so far as he cannot do so. For such a man, as such, is from the start no better than a vegetable…The starting-point for all such arguments is not the demand that our opponent shall say that something either is or is not (for this one might perhaps take to be a begging of the question), but that he shall say something which is significant both for himself and for another; for this is necessary, if he really is to say anything. For, if he means nothing, such a man will not be capable of reasoning, either with himself or with another. But if any one grants this, demonstration will be possible; for we shall already have something definite. … And again he who admits this has admitted that something is true apart from demonstration (so that not everything will be 'so and not so’)
