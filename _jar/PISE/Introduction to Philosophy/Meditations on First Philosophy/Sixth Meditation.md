# Sixth Meditation

<p class="date">13<sup>th</sup> October 2020</p>

At the end of the second meditation there still is a critical unsolved question: do bodies exist?

In the sixth meditation, Descartes proves that God exists and it's not a deceiver: whatever we subjectively perceive is objectively true.

Fundamental points:
- The distinction between understanding (intellect) imagination and senses
- The argument for the real separation
- The demonstration of the **existence of bodies**
- The interaction between mind and body
- The function of sensations
- The cause of some errors of the senses

(in the 5th meditation, the true essence of the bodies. The existence of the external world is the last thing Descartes proves)

 Imagination means to use matter to represent a purely intellectual concept:
 
 > So the difference between this mode of thinking [imagining] and pure understanding may simply be this: when the mind understands, it in some way turns towards itself and inspects one of the ideas which are within it; but when it imagines, it turns towards the body and looks at something in the body which conforms to an idea understood by the mind or perceived by the senses.
 
 I can better explain it if other bodies exist, but this is not a proof yet.
 
 The existence of bodies can be proved because I can't choose not to feel or not to perceive something, if I could, then again the mind would be in control of everything. Since I can't, I must acknowledge that there ore other bodies.
 
 (Since God is the author of our being, it's powerful and he made us perfect.)
 
 I can infer (p. 61) that if two entities appear to me as separate, they are indeed different and not one. Thus, having proved that my mind is independent from my body, I can say that my body and my mind are separate and independent and I can live without my body.
 
 These two substances are detachable at least by God.
 
 The only possibility is that all of my perceptions come from a single +++
 
 Possibilities for sensory perceptions sources:
 
 - God
 - external bodies

Why can't it be God?

He hasn't given us the possibility to understand it's him (or it's not him) that gives us those ideas. There is no way for us to understand/prove it's him who give us those ideas.
 
 God doesn't directly give the sensory feelings to us, since doing this would make him a deceiver, since he gave us no faculty to understand the source of our impressions, which otherwise seem to come from external bodies
