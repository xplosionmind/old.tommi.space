+++ up until the idea that having no God makes free

This thought was expressed in <cite>The Karamazov Brothers</cite> and sustained by Pierre Bayle: he wrote a dictionary, a sort of Encyclopedia on every argument discussed in his time; he considered a possibility of an atheist society.

Hume imagines an apology, a speech, made by Epicurus to defend his thought.
