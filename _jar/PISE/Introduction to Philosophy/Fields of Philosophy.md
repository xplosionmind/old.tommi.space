## Metaphysics

What is the nature of reality? 

What are the grounds of our beliefs, the nature of our reality. Strictly connected with ontology: the things we can see and experience in life

## Epistemology

- What is knowledge?
- Do we really know anything?
- How do we know and how can we be so sure?

From the Greek *episteme* (science, true and real knowledge): what knowledge is, how we achieve knowledge. The conditions that knowledge can create.

## Ethics

- What is good or right?
- What makes actions or people good or right?
- Is morality objective or subjective?

Justice -> God -> Political power (see [*Porta della Carta*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Palazzo_Ducale_%28Venice%29_-_Porta_della_carta.jpg) in Venice)

Venice is an important city from an historical and political point of view, since at the beginning of the 16th century it was the most progressive city in the occidental culture.

## Logic

- What makes good and bad reasoning?
- What are the principles of good/valid reasoning?

Logic is interested in consistency, thus the validity of an argument, studying the reasoning, without any interest to the content.
