# Knowledge

<p class="date">21<sup>th</sup> September 2020</p>

Knowledge can be considered as **the** problem of Philosophy. It's impossible to argue about Philosophy without arguing about knowledge, since they're strictly connected.

- How do we know what we know
- What are the conditions for knowledge

There are different kinds of epistemology depending from the discipline. Every philosopher discussed the problem of knowledge, but everyone gave a different answer.

Descartes and Hume interpreted knowledge as one of the primary problems of Philosophy also because they lived in the **[Scientific Revolution](https://www.britannica.com/science/Scientific-Revolution "Scientific Revolution on Encyclopædia Britannica") era**, a time when it was questioned and knowledge became the **center of the discussion in every field**.

Philosophy couldn't avoid dealing with the issue of knowledge. Philosophy is a tool to use to build upon a new society and a new structure.

René Descartes based all of his philosophy upon the argument of knowledge.

According to some philosophers, first among them Hegel, starting from Descartes Philosophy was identified with Epistemology. Then Descartes' arguments are the key to approach Epistemology and they offer a revolutionary point of view in the history of philosophy.

> René Descartes is a bold spirit who recommenced the whole subject from the very beginning and constituted afresh the groundwork on which Philosophy is based, and to which, after a thousand years had passed, it once more returned. The extent of the influence which this man exercised upon his times and the culture of Philosophy generally, cannot be sufficiently expressed; it rests mainly in his setting aside all former pre-suppositious and beginning in a free, simple, and likewise popular way, with popular modes of thought and quite simple propositions, in his leading to thought and extension or Being, and so to speak setting up this before thought as its opposite. **This simple thought appeared in the form of the determinate, clear understanding**.

## Plato: The Cave

Plato is the first philosopher to systematically address the problem of knowledge, even though he didn't considered it the main problem of philosophy. He used the tool of allegory, inventing the [allegory of the cave](https://youtu.be/QFi8JUIwu2s), in the 7<sup>th</sup> book of the <cite><a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Republic</a></cite>: he considered it strictly connected with the political problem of building a true new and just society.
1. Plato shows that we can firmly believe in reality, even if this is deceitful and not true. We describe reality as we are used to conceive it. The way we are used to perceive things influences the way we will see things in the future, too.
2. Even in a world of appearances there are **hierarchies**: awards and the world upon which they are built are **illusory**. A whole society its political structure is based on appearances.
3. **We can become aware of those perceptions**. The influence educations, tradition, etc. have on our conception of life and of the world

4. **Knowledge can be painful, it needs effort**, yet knowledge is worth to be reached, and who reaches it have a duty towards other people, it makes us responsible to share our “enlightened” vision
    - Habits and customs influence our notion of reality
    - Societies are grounded on appearances [What's on your mind](http://filmnosis/shortfilms/whats-on-your-mind)
    - Although many times “Ignorance is bliss”, knowledge must be shared

## René Descartes

[René Descartes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/) on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy

Understanding the new currents of thought, graduated in **law** at the university of Poitier, he then enrolled in the army of Nassau, a protestant prince. He spent a lot of time in Holland. He started the thirty years war in the protestant army, then, after one year, he moved to Germany.

in 1628 he started to work on several treaties, first among them <cite><a href="+++" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The rules for the Direction of the Mind</a></cite>, which remained incomplete because he started writing his 30 years long work <cite><a href="+++" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The World</a></cite> deciding not to publish it because +++

### The World

I imagine that God had created the world non in 6 days, but by using an indefinite amount of matter which had only one characteristic: extension (width, height, +++). Qualities, : smell, are not material. Sensible properties result from the interaction of our mind with the world.

He received a lot of criticisms for it.

Invited by her, and after a long time he decided to accept. After two months, because of the strong cold of the place, he got pneumia and died.

### The tree of knowledge

> The roots are metaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging from the trunk are all the other sciences, which may be reduced to three principal ones, namely medicine, mechanics and morals

[The Tree of Knowledge](https://prezi.com/-ccvgh4vc9wu/descartes/)

Metaphysics has a fundamental role.

The aim of Descartes (and other philosophers of the scientific revolution) is to criticize especially on form of previous philosophy: medieval and Aristotelic philosophy, especially [Saint Tommaso D'Acquino](+++), who interpreted Aristotelic Philosophy from a Christian point of view.

#### Parenthesis on Aristotelic Philosophy

From an ontological point of view, the Aristotelic philosophy of being, we consider Aristoteles' philosophy as

##### *Hylomorphism*

From Greek *hylē*, “matter”; *morphē*, “form”; the idea that every being, living and non-living, is composed by two elements:

- substantial **form**: a spiritual element which gives to a being all the conceptual properties which make it what it is.
- primary **matter**: a material element, an indefinite amount of matter which is connected with its form.

[Definition of hylomorphism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/hylomorphism) on Encyclopædia Britannica

<br>

The correspondent theory of knowledge is 

#### Empiricism

When we know something, we first experience it with our senses and then we generalize it through our imagination, and we grasp the essence of that being, concluding what that being is.

The first step of knowledge is the interaction with the object, then we know it by diving deeper into the essence of that being.

<br>

### *Meditations on First Philosophy*

### The “Trunk”

The only element which exist by itself is extension, everything else is given by the relation between us and the object. Example of cold hands in cold water and warm hands in cold water. Thus, subjective states.

The metaphysics objects of the Meditations

Why the existence

<p class="date">23<sup>rd</sup> September 2020</p>

The two main metaphysical points of the meditations
- Descartes dualism has an aim towards physics: if we can prove that the human mind can exist independently from the body, we can then conclude that the body is pure extension. Then the world (Physics) can be explained by **motion** and **matter** only.

The existence of God is needed to prove that Empiricism doesn't world: knowledge comes independently from the experience of the world, since God “implanted” some thoughts into our mind.

### Style

- The use of **first person** is essential, starting from the first point, since it argues about the existence of the self.

(Pierre Bayle, one of the first journalists) 

- +++
- Show and lead the way from error to truth. “Meditations” was used for religious writing, and it was chosen by Descartes to show an evolution, a progression, and a change. A change which can revolutionize our lives.

About using God to discard empiricism: Pascal criticizes the use of God to prove Descartes' point since in this way God is merely conceived as the starter of everything, but useless for everything else

<br>

## Truth

Identity between our ideas and reality. God, which doesn't want to deceive us, guarantees that if we are sure, we have no doubt about something, it means it's true. Clearness and distinctness mean truth

## First Meditation

Skepticism as a mean to reach knowledge. What is indoubtable is true, what is doubtable (not completely undoubtable) is false.

Not an answer to every possible question, but proving the minimum elements to explain Physics.

#### Arguments for doubting

> It is prudent never to trust completely those who have deceived on us even once

Not trusting senses

- Mad people +++
- The dream +++

(According to Descartes, children are Aristothelian)

Only one narrating person, but, actually, two distinct “Descarteses”: the child Descartes, and the adult, current, Descartes

It's impossible for us to doubt about mathematics, but is it possible to imagine something which could discard even Math? The answer is God.

the evil demon is a summary of all the previous arguments

<br>

### God

We have to prove the existence of God to later prove his not being daceitful. God guarantees that subjective certainty is an objective certainty, “a bridge”.

<br>

## Innatism

- The idea of the mind
- The idea of God
- Idea of the bodies -> extension -> mathematics

It is then not some kind of abstraction but the real essence of the world

<br>

## Hume

David Hume was born in Edimburgh, from a poor family. he was supposed to study law, which he hated. In the '30s he started to systematically study Philosophy. Because of the intensity and excitement of his intellectual discovery, he had a nervous breakdown in 1729.  In 1734, he came to the turning point of his life and retired to France for three years. Most of this time he spent at La Flèche on the Loire, studying and writing *A Treatise of Human Nature*. The Treatise was Hume’s attempt to formulate a full-fledged philosophical system. It is divided into three books:

1. Book I, “Of the Understanding,” discusses, in order, the origin of ideas; the ideas of **space and time**; knowledge and probability, including **the nature of causality**; and the skeptical implications of those theories.
2. Book II, “**Of the Passions**,” describes an elaborate psychological machinery to explain the emotional, order in humans and assigns a subordinate role to reason in this mechanism.
3. Book III, on **morals**, characterizes moral goodness in terms of “feelings” of approval or disapproval that people have when they consider human behaviour in the light of agreeable or disagreeable consequences, either to themselves or to others.

Since these books had very little success, he focused on publishing **essays**. Among them, there is *Enquiry on Human Understanding*.

(Essays: Montaigne the first one to use the essay form, but in a more personal way.)

The essay on Human Understanding became a bestseller, and he became rich.

He then moved to France and met Diderot, D'Allembert, Rousseau. He proposed to Rousseau to go to England.

+++

He decided to postpone the publication of the dialogues on human religion

<br>

Philosophy should be a science, the science which explains human behavior: the ways in which we feel, we act, we learn. Thus, useful to all sciences, since they all are studied by men.

> [9] we may observe, in every +++

<br>

The main epistemological assumption is **Empiricism**.

### Perceptions

***Perceptions*** are the essence of human relationship with the world (*Enquiry II*).

- **Impressions**: direct and clear products of immediate experience.
- **Ideas**: representations of previous impressions.

No difference between impressions and ideas, only a question of force.

> [4] +++

Principles of association among ideas:

- resemblance;
- contiguity in time or place;
- cause and effect (causality).

There are no rules to know, knowledge simply comes from the direct experience of and in the world.

+++

All of the possible sources of knowledge are

- **relations of ideas**: relationship of ideas not immediately intuitively connected among each other.
- **matters of fact**: propositions which can definitely be denied without contradiction. They describe the situation we can experience in the world, they speak about the world.

Difference between the two: (min 15~ of lesson 2020.09.29)

+++

We don't have access to the actual essence of the Universe, since we can't experience with our senses the core of reality. It's not a problem, we don't need metaphysics. We don't need to understand the core, we need to understand what we have. It's not important that we impose principles to other people, as we think it's better to think. Be a scientist, try to understand what it's necessary to understand. Descartes is connected 

**+++ quarter to 7**

We don't have proof of objectivity, but different skepticisms.

We can communicate with each other, so we can exchange opinions on everyday life. In normal

+++

Principle of causality

<p class="date">29<sup>th</sup> September 2020</p>

We can't consider all ideas mere copies of impressions. Ideas and impressions are combined by means of imagination. Our imagination doesn't act completely freely, it follows some rules[^1] 

Maths only as an abstraction when we generalize and abstract notions of the single objects we experience.

Platonic point of view (maths is real) vs Aristotelic point of view (maths is an abstraction). Different perspectives: later on every philosopher had to “pick a side”.

<br>

### Hume's critic to the principle of cause and effect

The principle of cause and effect is the most important one, since through this we can extend our knowledge of the world we can get through our senses.

*Cause* and *reason* conceived as synonyms at the time. 

How do we know the principle of cause and effect? How do we get the knowledge of it? How do we understand the cause of cause and effect? Why is it the most important principle?

+++ ~45

The certainty of this principle can't come by reasoning only. If we look at an object for the first time, we can't understand its causes and the possible effects.

Sometimes we don't need experience to infer the causes of some events (biliard ball example)
