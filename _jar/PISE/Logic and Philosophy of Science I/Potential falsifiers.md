Potential falsifiers are a specific class of observational statements, they're used to test universal statements. In Popper, they're called **basic statements**.

The logical role of basic statements is laid within a logical falsification: we use them to falsify universal statements, <u>not to verify them</u>, since to do the latter we'd need infinitely many observations.

> our “basic statements” are anything but “basic” in the sense of “final”; they are “basic” only in the sense that they belong to that class of statements which are used in testing our theories.
