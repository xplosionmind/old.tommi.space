## Francis Bacon

[Francis Bacon](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/francis-bacon/) was the one who really turned induction in a new science. He was against Aristhotelean method, finding it “hasty”, from [*The New Organon*][NO], written in aphorisms:

> [Aristothelean induction] flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from these principles proceeds to judgment and the discovery of the middle axioms.

The Aristotelian method became quite popular because it represents the natural way human mind work if it is let to itself. Nevertheless, Bacon points out that our minds are full of prejudices and these might deceive our mind.

### Idols

[Idols](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/francis-bacon/#Ido) in [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy][sep]

There are four types of Idols, explained from the 38<sup>th</sup> to the 62<sup>nd</sup> aphorism:
- **Idols of the Tribe** have their root in the human race and its nature, for it's similar to a distorting mirror: <u>it distorts our perceptions</u>.   
For example, human mind is prone to believe there is more order in nature than it is actually disposed to discover, and it often ends up producing dogmas and fallacious theories.   
Once we have an idea of something, we try to distort everything we know in order to make it correspond to our idea. By following this idol, senses often become inadequate and they can easily be deceived.
- **Idols of the Cave** are a consequence individuals' personal weaknesses in reasoning, due to their <u>particular personalities</u>, likes and dislikes.
- **Idols of the Market Place**, when people interact with each other;   
this is the place where idles are produced by the use of **languages** and their interaction. Words are normally used in their common meaning, but meanings are often conflicting because we have different purposes.   
- **Idols of the Theatre** derive from the academic dogmas and not asking questions about the world. Dogmas often end up creating fictional worlds, not necessarily justified.

### Wrong methods

#### Anticipation of nature

Being led to draw conclusions from premises not infected by idols is defined by Bacon as ***anticipation of nature*** (or anticipation of mind). This helps our way to get to scientific knowledge.

#### Induction by enumeration

It's bad education to infer principles of science through simple enumerations, namely through simple experience, for it relies on isolated observations, which don't lead to enough knowledge and understanding.

If we were to perform observations without a method, a guidance, we may be able to draw conclusions, but without a substantial and reliable evidence. Therefore, a good guidance is needed to get to accountable conclusions.

> Those who have handled the sciences have been either Empiricists or Rationalists. Empiricists, like **ants**, merely collect things and use them. The Rationalists, like **spiders**, spin webs out of themselves. The middle way is that of the **bee**, which gathers its materials from the flowers of the garden and field, but then transforms and digests it by a power of its own.

### The right way

#### Experience

We go from a well organized experience to the principles and then we draw the principles again: this is the good induction that is draw by a guidance.   
Our senses require a guidance because they can easily misinform us. As an educated lawyer, Bacon says we need to vex/**interrogate nature** as if we were interrogating a witness.

> it shall analyse experience and take it to pieces, and by a due process of exclusion and rejection lead it to an inevitable conclusion.

> [Good induction proceeds by] rejections and exclusions, and then after a sufficient number of negatives, come to a conclusion on the affirmative instances.

<p class="cite">~ Francis Bacon, <cite><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Novum_Organum" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Novum Organum</a></cite>, Aphorism 105</p>

This is the method he prefers to the Aristotelian induction by enumeration; Bacon's method rely on experience and what he calls ***gradual induction***.

> Facts are particulars, various, diffuse. They must be arranged in a suitable order

<p class="cite">~ Francis Bacon, <cite><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Novum_Organum" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Novum Organum</a></cite>, Book II, Aphorism 10</p>

Experience amounts to facts arranged in a suitable order, not only plain and passive observation. In order to achieve this, we need the device of **rules** that allows us to <u>classify facts</u>.

This should be done by using **tables**:
- Tables of absence and presence
- Tables of deviation
- Tables of degrees or comparison

Subsequently, we collect all of these instances in ***histories***, which are records of instances of facts and they concern either natural occurrences or artificial creations of experiments.

#### Gradual Induction

At this point, everything is left to the interpretation of gradual induction. This process provides a well prepared experience to <u>apply induction in a good way</u>. Only if we do this Induction can take its proper course.

+++He applies it to the heat, hence he shows it can be done, and after concluding the experiment, he concludes that heat is motion. He does this by discarding many apparently good candidates/ assumptions, using his inductive method.+++

Bacon revolutionizes the perspective of scientific reasoning by introducing his interpretation of induction.
Bacon’s text is full of metaphors and images.
There are two vintages to gradual induction:
1. It produces an hypothesis
2. It allows further testing to establish the results with greater confidence.   
The aim is to provide <q>not elegant and probable conjectures, but certain and demonstrable knowledge.</q>

Bacon's rules of induction became the best way to discover the truth of premises that in the Aristotelian format were somewhat taken for granted.   
Thus, we can attribute a better evidence to the premises, which can lead us to better conclusions.   
We now have demonstrable knowledge that is different from the Aristotelian one.

Bacon wants, in his scientific method, to rely on an idea of <u>indubitability rather than infallibility</u>, namely focusing on what can be proven about an idea rather than what can be attached to it.

In the [*New Organon*][NO], Bacon proclaims we should rely on his method because it is the best available one.

Once we embrace Bacon’s method, according to him, we have a method that can lead us to good results, independently of individual skills. If this method is followed correctly, <u>its conclusions cannot be doubtable</u>.

This is a new territory of debate and study: Bacon must convince the scientific world that his method is good to follow, while having to face the very long Aristotelian tradition.

Bacon agrees that the results his method brings about are <u>not taking us to infallible certainties</u>, because infallibility is proper of logic, which is proper of deduction.   
Still, Bacon gives us reasons to believe that it is possible to reach some **formal certainties**, by filling his book with further tools that should make us more comfortable with the ideas he suggests.

Bacon suggests that conclusions well accompanied by evidences are to be considered more comfortable, more certain. By using the word “certain” Bacon means empirical indubitability rather than logical infallibility.

- Is this optimism really motivated?
- How reliable is induction even in this laboriously described manner?

Since here we observed that, for what concerns deduction: (all Italians eat is pasta; Eleonora is Italian; Eleonora eats pasta); we start from a universal statement and end up to a specific statement. This is the logical syllogism. The peculiarity of deductive reasoning is that, if the premises are true, than the conclusion is also true and vice versa. In this type of reasoning, we conclude something on the middle term that is included in the major term, but how do we know the premises are true? It is a problem for Aristotle when he makes logic bare on science. How do we know all Italians eat pasta? The idea here is we acquire a wide enough number of repeated instances (induction by enumeration) and then we subdue this list to a series of condition (what Bacon tries to do) and we then feel entitled to state what we state. We are now generalizing to the universal case. All Italians eat pasta in a generalization, in an inductive approach. Then we now go from the single case/instances to the general rule/statement.
The principle of induction: if a large number of objects As have been observed under a wide variety of conditions, and if all those observed As without exceptions possessed the property b, then all As have b. It will make legitimate not only how we go from the particular to the universal, but also it’ll allow us to draw conclusions on the instances that have yet to be observed.
All swans are white. We can draw two conclusions: probably, the next swan I’ll see will be white, and, probably, all the other swans I’m going to see are going to be white. Induction relies on experience and on senses, for example we use induction when we expect to be attending classes day after day: we have an empirical proof to be expecting to find the teacher the following days. We are entering a slightly dangerous territory: the conclusion of deductive inference does not say much more than its premises, and if the premises is true I will be assured the conclusion is also true. Still, induction can’t make us so certain. How wide must be our number of observed facts to be certain of them, for example?
The whole point in science, as reminded by Bacon, is to establish the truth of the premises, to improve and expand our knowledge. And deductive reasoning doesn’t expand our knowledge, while induction does.
How justified are we in making these assumptions? We know how risky it is to follow induction, specifically from a logical point of view: in an induction, we might start from true premises but could eventually end up with a wrong conclusion. Do really all Italians eat pizza? I can even say all swans are white, even if I haven’t seen them: this is very dangerous of induction.
David Hume analyzed the problem of induction. What is his strategy to face induction and to correctly use it to increase our knowledge? He faces these problems in his book “An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding”.
The first distinction is that all the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally (02:06:00) Relations of ideas: propositions that are discoverable by the mere operation of thought; even if there were no triangles on Earth, Pitagora’s theorem would still be true. They are subject to logical contradiction as well and they can be demonstrated to be false
Matters of facts: the contradiction comes out when we make a logical contradiction, but here it is not as easy as in the relations of ideas. We cannot say “the sun will rise tomorrow” if the sun doesn’t exist: the sun’s existence is not a matter of logic, so it is not possible to find out whether such a proposition is true merely by reasoning. We need to appeal to experience. If we do this, we defeat the very purpose of inference in the first place, for inference wants to arrive to conclusion before using senses to draw a conclusion.
Apriori knowledge of matters of facts is impossible.
Relations of ideas can be known by deductive relations.
Hume wants to enquire how are we able to establish the truth of our proposition without experience, how it is possible to infer a universal generalization “the sun will always rise” from a collection fo observation of what the sun has done up until today.
Hume says that only some of our factual knowledge is based on something we perceive directly.
If you were to ask a man why he believes his friend his out of town, he will reply by giving another matter of fact, like he has received a letter from his friend where he says he is out of town. A man finds a watch in a desert island, therefore he concludes there must have been someone else there before him, without direct acquaintance.
All matters of facts relies on a present facts and another fact which the former is inferred from. How do we reason here? Exactly in the same way in which we reason when we connect an effect to a cause: we see something and we asked ourselves what brought it about. How do we formulate this type of reasoning? Are we entitled to make this connection? Can we acquire knowledge from this connection?
