History informs method: a physicist at Harvard, with an interest to philosophy

+++ intro

Copernicus as a model. <cite>The Copernical Revolution</cite> upon which he built his own method, which led to his famous <cite>The structures of Scientific Revolution</cite>

Accogding to Kuhn the development of science isn't linear: quiet period alternate to mor active periods. Unstable periods are <q>revolutionary</q>.

What happens during periods of normal science? "business as usual"
- <q>puzzle solving</q>: not actual problems, puzzles which are solved through universally shared methods.
- mixture: shared commitments to solve what comes up

#### Scientific paradigm

+++ what is it

Principia Mathematica by Newton as a major example.

The normal scientist has to believe in his/her paradigm no matter what. A normal science is a mono-paradigmatic science. Nothing threatens the paradigm and its basis.

Popper comes back into play: dogmatism is the risk. THis is why he strongly disagrees with Kuhn's view. He not only dislikes it, but he starts to question Kuhn's authority. Scientist should take rish, push forward interpretations etc.

The normal science goes on until <q>anomalies</q> come up: a puzzle can't be solved with the current paradigm:
- <q>crisis</q>, followed by a
- revision, which brings a proper
- scientific revolution. Revolution used with a political interpretation: a change at 360°

when we realize that we've completed a revolution, we already are in a new paradigm.

How this happens in historical terms

Rarely there are rules which lead to a crisis, revision or revolutions, but external factors: they may have to do with values
