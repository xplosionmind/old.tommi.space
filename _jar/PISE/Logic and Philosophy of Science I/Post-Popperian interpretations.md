# Criticisms to Popper's Philosophy of Science

## Logical objections

Logical objections focus on:
- the empirical status of basic observations (potential falsifiers)
- the role of potential falsifiers in deductive falsification

Basic statements aren't not incorrigible

Any theory admits of an indefinite (maybe infinite) number of potential falsifiers. Which theory then becomes the the best to use in a certain case?

- it needs to be verified the degree of corroboration
- at any given time only a +++ slides

If all possible tests were performed, we'd theoretically get to the same result

By doing so, I need to use an inductive process to get to a deductive one.


Popper knows this may be a problem and he defends his thesis by stating that the degree of corroboration doesn't look at the future.

Why does a certain degree of corroboration should prefer a theory rather than the other.

The approach we choose should at least be more promising to get to the same result more effectively. This methodology operates only with a negative evidence.

Given this, what do we have to be able to assess which of the two theories is better to adopt?


### Second logical problem

why should we trust that our basic statements and our falsifiers work?

Basic Statements are not incorrigible.

+++ **trying to listen instead of noting**

It's not a matter of experience, but it's about a matter of decisions. Scientific jury. Even if we grant this qualification, this doesn't grant Popper a strong basis.

Ultimately Popper agrees that basic statements aren't grounded conjectures; nevertheless he points out that it's the best conjecture you can make; and the scientific community agrees on that.

### Third logical problem

Trust in observation: back to the argument of experience; since "conjectures always come first", are we really saying that we're really dealing with experience or an interpretation of experience?

I'll never be sure if what I experience having conjectured something before, by having a theory, that my experience won't be distorted by my theory's point of view.

The only solution may be to completely separate theories and practical measurements and experience.

## Historical objections

A number of Popper's old pupils tried to create "improved" versions of falsification: getting rid of theory isn't so automatic and immediate as Popper philosophy. Scientists often persist with their method
