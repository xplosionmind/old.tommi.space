# The Scientific explanation

<p class="date">26<sup>th</sup> November 2020</p>

How do scientific theories achieve the task of explaining science?

The explanatory power of scientific theory relies on the laws it's built upon

## From a practical point of view

The example of an increase in temperature in a glass of water and the effect on a thermometer inside it.

How can we describe the explanation that a scientist gives about the experiment?

## Two types of statement

- a statement which includes a series of contingent conditions
- a few / a couple (+++) general statements

Together, these statements make sense of what we see.

# Hempel

[Carl Hempel](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hempel/ "Carl Hempel on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy") on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy

The role of +++ is to explain phenomena and theories derive their explanatory power by a series of general statements from which stem the description of specific instances.

## General statements

These general statements are what we define as scientific laws.

Of course, to achieve their explanatory value, they must have a set of features:
- Statements of a universal form
- yet, they're relevant to what I'm seeing here and now

> +++

+++

Every time we try to explain some event, we need to refer to ha general explanatory law. Once we have a law, we have an explanation.

+++

## The Deductive-nomological model

If the law is true, then deductively it will lead to a correct explanation.

On the assumption that we're using a correct law, then we're sure the logical connection is valuable.

+++ the question before mine

It is the same as syllogistic statements. +++


What explains this correlation is explained.

### Two ways of addressing this

Pick the right level of universality for these statements

Accidental generalizations: general statements, yet limited to the contingent observation in question.

On the opposite, there needs to be a general statement which is always valid (all gases expand +++)

Can universality be tested?

Substitute the particular observation in an instance in a if-then form: if a universal statement is a good candidate as a scientific law, it should be able to work.

These statements are ***conterfactuals***: they're not actual events, they're purely hypothetical and they're not empirically performed, yet they're needed to prove the validity of a statement as a law.

A test for genuine universality. A test for the capacity of the statements.

## Second way

Laws are ***ceteris paribus***, all things being equal:

Laws hold the truth when they're able to keep away elements which are beyond the scope of the law.

Example of Galileo laws of motion: they're true under highly idealized conditions. The general law idealizes the conditions in which it should be applied.

[[Nancy Cartwright]]

## Why scientific laws?

Laws lie visavis real phenomena, but they can handle ideal phenomena

Why then laws are so important, and to Hempel are at the cernter of the discussion?

Because they provide us with an explanation. Nevertheless, such laws must be true, or data they provide aren't reliable.

## Truth of Scientific laws

It may be about
- a matter of logic
- a matter of how they portray what goes on in the real world

Then logic alone can't succeed in defining laws.

Try to describe what **actually** goes on in science, what happens, in order to understand the an explanation.

The key question is: if a law expresses a regularity, what explains the regularity itself?

We infer what we may call empirical regularities from laws of broader and broader scope. +++

The example of Newton's law of gravitation: *gravitation* is the name Newton gave to a force which we can't directly observe:   
***if*** Newton's law is true, ***then*** certain correlations can be explained

What does the explaining is the actual inference.

A complete view:

+++

the ultimate value of a theory is dependent from the degree of generalization. From empirical data to laws always more abstract and general.

+++ grasping where explanatory power lies

The way I explain an inference is always the same.

## Problems of Hempel's view

### Fist problem

The very idea of explanation

why is it that –e.g.– some materials are affected by some 

+++

Example of the two descriptions / formulations of Newton's gravitational law.

We don't only state the correlation, we account for it.

Pushing the boundaries: going well beyond the logical understanding. Laws postulate what's actually out there in the universe waiting for a sperimentation to prove or reject it

### Second problem

The model of theory in this account. A theory is +++ FROM SLIDES

> if a body were free of forces, it would move at constant velocity

Logic isn't enough: in the real world there are no object which can be free of forces!

So scientific theories are ontological maps of the inner constitution of the world; they should explain why phenomena behave the way they do at the observable level.

It follows that theories become very risky devices: they might discover entities that turn out not to exist

An alternative to scientific explanation beyond logic: [[Scientific realism]]

### Third problem

The role of theories and hypotheses in this model: how do we account for the discovery of hypotheses?

From Popper's point of view, the procedure to follow. +++

#### The hypotetico-deductive model

1. Observation
2. Hypothesis formulation
3. deduction of a consequence to the hypotheses
4. +++

> +++

Hempel agrees with Popper on this

> +++

Guesses and the connection we might obtain from phenomena

At this point, Hempel disagrees with Popper:   
testing doesn't mean falsification
- if a hypothesis is not true, it's not false, but ***disconfirmed***
- if an hypotheses is +++

summing up +++


+++


## Testing the hypotheses

Mixed reasoning:
- inference from an hypotheses to a p is deductive
- inference from the truth of p +++

### The problem of auxiliary assumptions

- the consequent doesn't follow from the hypotheses alone
- the role of *auxiliary assumptions*

+++

#### The Duhem-Quine problem

##### The *holistic* view

We aren't testing individual theories and hypotheses, but a whole set of ad-hoc assumptions, auxiliary hypotheses, etc.

Theories are not just logical structures, but ontological maps of the world.

To Hempel, we may also use induction, even if this doesn't mean that the hyp will be true for sure, it can only be confirmed.

### The raven Paradox

A paradox of relevance, of using relevance for testing.

It comes from two main ideas:
- **instance confirmation**, [Nicod's principle](+++)   
> +++ FROM SLIDES
- **equivalence condition**: logically equivalent statements are confirmed by the same evidence

thus

1. <q>all ravens are black</q>, which is logically equivalent to
2. <q>everything that is not black is not a raven</q>

But in here it lies a contradiction: the more black ravens I see, the more I prove statement `1`, but according to the equivalence condition, even collecting data which confirms the second statement would also confirm the first one, which is absurd.

We're assuming a world where everything is either a black raven, or is not a raven.

The world is divided in
- ~~not black ravens~~
- black ravens
- non ravens

non black non ravens

If we observe a green chair, it tells us nothing about ravens, it's not relevant, nevertheless, it's considered valuable for the equivalence condition.

From Goodman:

> +++

<br>

Back to the hypothetical- deductive model:

does this describe how scientists conduct their work?

[[Semmelwise]]

## A different type of reasoning

Inferring **to** the hypotheses: inference to the best explanation.

> +++

## Lipton, Inference to the Best Explanation

+++ link to Lipton

Semmelwise to him reasoned in IBE, not H-D.

Underlying this idea of IBE, is the logical move of trying to understand if we can infer *to* an hypotheses before inferring *from* an hypotheses.

[[Peirce]]

How did Kepler arrive to his first law?

> +++

The H-D method accounts to the process pursued after having an hypotheses, how to "**catch**" it instead.

## Criticisms of abduction

Abduction cannot be a logic of discovery, because the hyp is already included (or supposed to be known) in the premises

we can locate abduction between discovery and testing


## Inference to the *best* hypotheses

Two problematic areas:
- how to formulate sci hyp
- how we come to postulate the entities we use in sci laws in order to explain what we observe at an empirical level

We often infer the existence of such entities +++

Looking at scientific theories in terms of postulates we're not basing our theories of something not sure; nevertheless if these theories work they are a satisfactory result anyway.

How do we know what we call “electron” etc. is actually what we see in the world?

How do we explain that electrons and quarks are actually “natural kinds”?
