This place is <strong>a perpetual work in progress</strong> populated by thoughts, drivel, visions, questions, sort-of-answers, kinda-intuitions, contraddictions, disorderly attempts of reordering stuff, representations of chaos.
	<br>Welcome to tommi.space, <u>the virtual representation of Tommi’s mind</u>.
	<br>Have fun!</p>
