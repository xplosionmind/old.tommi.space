I impulsively bought a [reMarkable tablet](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2 'reMarkable 2') out of curiosity, after two years after finding out about its existence. I bought it with the purpose of giving it back in the 30 days test period, only to test it for a bit.  
I am giving it back mainly for the reason that it is a **watershed product**, valuable and clever, but still <u>too pricey for what it offers</u>. The writing and drawing experience is excellent, almost perfect. Everything else lacks a lot of important features both from the software and the hardware points of view.

Surprisingly, there is a lot of community open source software development happening behind the scenes, but it still is largely unstable and makes the usage experience much heavier. Nevertheless, [Toltec](https://toltec-dev.org/ 'Toltec package manager') is very nice, useful, and rich of great applications.

## Missing features

- Browser
- Straight lines tool / ruler
- Dark background
- split screen between two or more notes
- more info popup when clicking on the WiFi or cloud icon in the home
- VPN support
- custom sleep and off splash screen
- automatic landscape-portrait rotation of a note (if I switch, the text should not keep its original orientation)

### Hardware

- Backlit display
- RGB color
- easier and more ergonomic pen/color/thickness switcher
- automatic landscape/portrait rotation
