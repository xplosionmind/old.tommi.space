description: Insights, guides, notes and ideas about completely switching to Linux.
---
Even though [[Linuxplosion]] runs Linux, specifically Ubuntu, it has to be said that 98% of my computer activity is performed on a MacBook Pro 13' 2019 running, guess what, MacOS. I love MacOS and I would not give it up for anything in the world, but I gotta admit that deep inside me I feel that the day where I will drop everything and exclusively use Linux is getting closer and closer.  
Therefore, I gather here stuff for when I will be ready, or for people like me who are on the edge and who would like to dive a bit deeper into the matter before doing anything reckless.  
There you go.
