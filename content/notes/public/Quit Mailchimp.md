## Why

[Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com 'Mailchimp') is almost ubiquitous. It even acquired [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/ 'TinyLetter'). It is growing bigger and bigger and it exploits user data. I feel very bad bout having to hand my subscribers’s data to this company.

<br>

## Alternatives

### Self hosted

- [Mailtrain](https://mailtrain.org 'Mailtrain')
- [listmonk](https://listmonk.app 'listmonk')

<br>

### Ad interim

Viable *ad interim* solutions if somebody has the same hard time as me in setting up Mailtrain.

- [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email 'Buttondown') (if you subscribe now, you will subscribe through it)
