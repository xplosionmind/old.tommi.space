I found out about [Quantified Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self 'Quantified Self on Wikipedia') from [the list about it](https://project-awesome.org/woop/awesome-quantified-self 'Awesome Quantified Self') on [Project Awesome](https://project-awesome.org 'Project Awesome'). I am trying to embrace this philosophy and lifestyle, because I believe in it. Nevertheless, I am struggling a lot with the logging part, since I am a scatterbrain.

<br>

## Getting Started

The basic idea is trying to pinpoint daily events and feelings which could be relevant to keep track of on the long run.

## My logs

- **Sun Salutation**: checking if every morning I perform [<cite>Sūrya Namaskāra</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Namaskar '“Surya Namaskar” on Wikipedia')
- **Dreams logging**: write down summaries of dreams
- **Wallet**: logging expenses, earnings, and savings
- *[[Esame di coscienza]]*: every night, revise the events of the day to check what could be improved and what shouldn't be repeated.

## Resources

> The **quantified self** refers both to the cultural phenomenon of self-tracking with technology and to a community of users and makers of [self-tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-tracking 'Self-tracking') tools who share an interest in <q>self-knowledge through numbers</q>. Quantified Self practices overlap with the practice of [lifelogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelog 'Lifelog') and other trends that <u>incorporate technology and data acquisition into daily life</u>, often with the goal of improving physical, mental, and/or emotional performance.

> The key concept is that you will tell the system what you’re trying to achieve, and it will then build you a plan for achieving those goals based on everything it knows about what works and what doesn’t work for people like you.
