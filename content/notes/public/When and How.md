There is no actual meaning for what happens in the world right now. There is no what, there is no real why, everything, anything, is reduced to a matter of timing and exposition.

The container is the content (<b class='missing'>+++</b>), they say. The reason eventually traces back to a personal motive, either justified by a trauma or propelled by a latent lust for personal gain.

What becomes relevant, the only things that matters, become the timing factor, the presentation factor and the **quantity** factor. It is not a matter of framing [@Entman] anymore, it is a matter of assessing when it is the right time to act and how to do so; finally, the factor of overwhelmingness of information, relentlessly proliferating and spreading everywhere puts the cherry on top of a rich, confused, irrational cake that is our world.
