description: I get distracted very easily, an my mind goes from a topic to a totally different one in no time. While this can be a great quality to be creative (not so much, in the end), it is a very stressful, time-consuming and unproductive lifestyle. This is why I conceived slots.

  - Check duplication with “The Slot Philosophy”

Slots are simply **time slots**: half or full hours which I devote to something. If a new idea —not strictly related to what I am doing— pops up in my mind, I write it down to remember it, but I get to it only when it is the time to commit to the related slot. Nevertheless, this way of working poses a dilemma: [where would my distraction go if I was capable of focusing?](/distrazione 'Sconnesso: Dove andrebbe la mia distrazione se mi concentrassi?'). Furthermore, this is an ideal lifestyle, but definitely far from my actual way of living; I am trying to compromise and both develop and approach to this method slowly and carefully.

***The Slot Philosophy*** is awesome because each slot can be rearranged everyday, and its accomplishment can be tracked through [[Self tracking]] apps such as [Loop Habit Tracker](https://loophabits.org "Loop Habits official website") (which is the one I use).

## Tools

- [Timelines](https://timelines.app/ 'Timelines App'), an iOS only app for time tracking. It is incredibly similar to my concept of [[Nolan|Timeline]], but it has a pro subscription which is not worth it.
- [Monofocus](https://monofocus.app/ 'Monofocus'), setting WIP short-term tasks and get periodical reminders to focus specifically on one single task only
