description: Conversion to RSS, everywhere. It is the right way
---
I am an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS 'RSS') lover.   
If it was up to me, I would use RSS everywhere; but, unfortunately, it is not. Since 99% of the people have no idea what it is, and half of that remaining 1% think it is dead, the 0.5% of us have to find some ways to continue using it for everything everywhere, in order to enlighten the view of the non-geeks (most of the above mentioned 99%) and the skeptics.

## Philosophy

My dream is for RSS to replace social media.  
Of course, it will never happen, and I would be super happy if only the [Fediverse](https://fediverse.party 'Fediverse Party') gained more popularity. I explained in a better way this philosophy by writing about the alternatives to Social Media in [quitsocialmedia.club](https://quitsocialmedia.club/soluzioni 'Quit Social Media').

Mainly, the point is this: let’s use RSS to connect and exploit the power of a [decentralized](https://redecentralize.org/ 'Redecentralize'), [self-owned](https://ownyourdata.foundation/ 'Own Your Data'), possibly even [self-hosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted 'Awesome Self Hosted') internet.

## Tools

- [PolitePol](https://github.com/taroved/pol 'PolitePol repository on GitHub') is a great tool transform any webpage in a RSS feed. It is [madly expensive](https://politepol.com/en/prices 'PolitePol'), so I set it up on my server. You may check and use it by visiting [pol.tommi.space](https://pol.tommi.space 'PolitePol'); very surprisingly I was able to configure it but it doesn't work for Twitter and Instagram, as I hoped. Therefore, it’s quite useless.
- [RSS-Bridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge 'RSS Bridge on GitHub'), it parses RSS feeds from several internet services.
- [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com 'Feedbin official website') is the RSS reader I use. It is awesome.
- [NetNewsWire](http://netnewswireapp.com 'NetNewsWire official website') is the client for both iOS and MacOS which synchronizes with Feedbin.
- Something I miss is <u>a nice and neat <strong>images first</strong> feed reader</u>. Feedbin and NetNewsWire are not optimal to view media.
- I got in touch with the developer of [1Feed](https://1feed.app '1Feed'), and we share a lot of common interests, I am starting using it. It is wonderful for tweets and brief content.
