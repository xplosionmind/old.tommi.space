description: Lists are everywhere, and they are taking over literature
toc: false

Nobody is noticing this, but lists are taking over the world. There are lists everywhere, to explain concepts, to list features, to suggest things, to say anything. I am even making a list right now, by providing an argument against lists themselves.

May they be bullet point lists, numbered lists, or comma separated values, they have no context, no verbal connection or links made by words. You see? I'm starting to make a list, again.

It may be only me, but watch out and steer clear from lists.
