I heard [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz 'Aaron Swartz on Wikipedia') for the first time when a friend I was talking to about why [I quit social media](https://quitsocialmedia.club 'quitsocialmedia.club') said that I reminded her of him. Curious, I searched for him on Wikipedia, and immediately I realized how humbling the comparison was.  
Later on, by getting more and more interested in his biography and his legacy (in particular after watching <cite>[The Internet’s Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet's_Own_Boy '“The Internet’s Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz„ on Wikipedia')</cite>), I got to the conclusion that Aaron is [one of my most inspiring idols](/people#aaron-swartz 'Aaron Swartz in the list of all my favorite people'), and that his initiatives perfectly match with my philosophy and my utopistic hopes for the future of the internet.

In particular, I love his ideas of diffusing [[Common Knowledge]] and making [[Knowledge|learning resources]] accessible to all.
