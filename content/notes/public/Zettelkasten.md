[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten 'Zettelkasten on Wikipedia') is a system for storing and accessing notes invented by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann 'Niklas Luhmann on Wikipedia'). I am very fascinated by its underlying philosophy and approach which I would love to take advantage of, but I am still learning and it will take quite a lot of time to fully commit to it.

The word does not quite describe a topic whose meaning is much deeper and more complex than the mere concept of linking one’s own notes. The most insightful writing I read, that best tackles the obnoxious dilemmas Personal Knowledge Management poses is <cite>[Synthesizing Bonsai](https://manunam.me/post/bc5dbb857c/ '“Synthesizing Bonsai„ on manunam’s blog')</cite>

## The Problem

The problem of Zettlekasten is that there is a worrying risk (at least, for me) to end up spending a ridiculously great amount of time collecting and organizing thoughts and knowledge, and less and less time actually learning something valuable or formulating intelligent ideas.

Either one can find an equilibrium among the two—but it requires very strong self-awareness and intelligence—,or she is better of dropping this knowledge management system.

The most suited—yet exaggerated—example to express my feeling is what happened to [[Aby Warburg]]. Enthusiastic and psyched about his plan to create <cite>[Atlas Mnemosyne](https://warburg.library.cornell.edu/about '“About the Mnemosyne Atlas„ - Warburg Library')</cite>, he got overwhelmed with a tremendous amount of inputs, and [he ended up schizophrenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aby_Warburg#Return_to_Hamburg 'Final moments of Aby Warburg’s life on Wikipedia').

## Software

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md 'Obsidian'), a fresh, recent, powerful and intriguing Zettlekasten-centered app.   
It’s not open source, there have been a lot of discussions about this, yet it’s arguably the best.
