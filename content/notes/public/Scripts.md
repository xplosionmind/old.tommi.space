description: Scripts I need to create
toc: false
---
The following are ideas for scripts I would like to code both to learn bash and to automate most of the commands I frequently perform manually.

<br>
<br>

## Jam kitchen

- options: `[R] for a recording\n[S] to edit settings\n[Q] to quit`
- open a file whose name is read in stdin

<br>
<br>

## Slogger

Logging anything happening to my life, saving it in a shared database. A sort of front-end client for the [[Nolan|Timeline]].

<br>
<br>

## Smart caps

Finding some simple way to take documents formed by capitals or small caps only, and format them according to arbitrary criteria.
