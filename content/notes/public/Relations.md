[emotional.codes](https://emotional.codes 'a collection of tools that I’ve found useful for processing emotions and having interpersonal interactions.') is some sort of a [[Self debugging]], but taking place by talking with other people outside of yourself

### Meta

About the importance of reciprocal openness and explicitness concerning relationship feelings:

> I want to build relationships where everyone involved is able to explicitly talk about what they want to get out of it, and how we can work together to make each other happy. I’ve found that having defining the relationship discussions has been an effective way to do this.

### Collective reciprocal feelings sharing

> Feelings checkin is a [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/ 'Recurse Center') tradition, which is designed to give people a space to share and process their feelings. \[…\] It’s really easy to do, so if you would value having a space to process your emotions, you too can start a feelings checkin group!  
> Feelings checkin is a weekly event, usually with somewhere from 3 to 10 people who attend. It’s a space to reflect on the feelings you’ve had over the past week. It’s held in a private, hopefully comfy room.
