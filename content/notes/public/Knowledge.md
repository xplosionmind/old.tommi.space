  An eternally incomplete yet continuously growing collection of the sources of my knowledge

Almost every single portion of this website is a more or less organized collection of what I know and how I connect my knowledge. Nevertheless, it is useful to keep track in this page of some insightful resources that I would lose otherwise.

## University

On this website there is very little concerning what I study for university and my notes, that I am forced to keep private for copyright reasons. I spent a lot of time and efforts to develop [pise-notes.club](https://web.archive.org/web/20210521084059/https://pise-notes.club/ 'Snapshot of the website'), a website where I collected all of my university notes, but the [PISE](https://unive.it/pise 'Philosophy, International Studies and Economics') head professor made me take it down.

## Geek

Where and how to learn about Computer Sciences topics and anything technology related.

## Costituzione italiana

<p lang='it'>È assurdo che io abbia una così scarsa conoscenza della Costituzione e delle leggi che governano il mio paese. Ho chiesto ad amici che studiano giurisprudenza di indicarmi dove e come posso cercare articoli in base a parole chiave o in base al contesto. Purtroppo lo stato italiano non offre un sistema ufficiale per cercare le informazioni e la digitalizzazione della Costituzione ha funzionalità estremamente limitate rispetto alle potenzialità che internet offrirebbe. In ogni caso, l’utilizzo di questi servizi diversi può essere molto utile</p>
