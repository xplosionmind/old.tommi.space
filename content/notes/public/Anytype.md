<div class='blue box'>
	Below there are my notes, thoughts and doubts concerning the project, but I have many more which I already <a href='https://community.anytype.io/u/tommi/activity' target='_blank' title='My “Activity” page on Anytype Community'>posted on Anytype community</a>.
</div>

- how does Anytype connect to the outer world?
- basic data structure is in JSON?
- is the public front-end going to be customizable with a personal CSS and own TLD, etc.?
- ActivityPub/Fediverse implementation + Webmentions: how to link stuff which comes also from outside Anytype
- media files focus
- Personal data management implementation (check every CSV and its Shortcut)
- Co-existing media: not only avoid duplications in the system, but also make Anytype format compatible with other programs not only by exporting, but while files are in the app.
- understanding what/how much is stored locally and what/when it is kept in the backup server, according to which principle. Criteria for storing huge files? https://community.anytype.io/t/allow-user-to-initiate-full-sync-and-sync-for-a-perticular-object/2572
- Plugins?
