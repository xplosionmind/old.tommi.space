[JavaScript] is awesome. It is so awesome that it is becoming ubiquitous, and some claim it is destroying the internet.

Nevertheless, I could not care much and I know it definitely is the next programming language I have to learn. I must learn it. Nowadays, I believe that knowing JavaScript well enough any guy with an idea can make it true by using few or no other languages.

The point is that I am both lazy and excessively busy, and to actually learn a programming language, even though intuitive and high level, requires a lot of time to spare and a great deal of curiosity to overcome the most tricky passages (such as addresses and pointers in C, for instance).

I am stacking here everything I find out on the web which might be useful for when I am finally going to get into the magical universe of JavaScript.
