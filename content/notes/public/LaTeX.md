## Premise

> Writing should be a pleasant experience. With the right tools, it can be. LaTeX is powerful but cumbersome to use. With Markdown, we can focus on our writing, and worry about the presentation later.

<p class='cite'>Jake Zimmerman, <cite><a href='Reach for Markdown, not LaTeX'  target='_blank' title='Reach for Markdown, not LaTeX'>Reach for Markdown, not LaTeX</a></cite></p>

My intentions are to <u>avoid LaTeX the most I can</u>. I love Markdown, it is simple and quick. LaTeX becomes useful when it is needed to write or draw complex stuff in a neat way. This is why I need to master it, at least some bit.
