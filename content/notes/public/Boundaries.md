description: Boundaries to improve living quality
---
I believe the foundations of a peaceful, productive and full life are composed of a combination of [[Loops|habits]] and [[Boundaries|boundaries]].\
Below are the ones I set to myself.

<div class='blue box'>The following decisions go hand in hand with [[The Slot Philosophy]], which is my main approach to [[Self improvement]]</div>

- from 2013, stop playing any videogame and stop installing any game app on my mobile
- from June 2016, [turning off all push notifications](https://www.wired.com/story/turn-off-your-push-notifications/ '“Turn off your Push Notifications” on Wired'), except alarms and reminders
	- you do not actually miss any message
	- you can leave internet and everything turned on, nothing will distract you unless really important and worth your immediate attention
- from 9<sup>th</sup> November 2020, never use my laptop while in bed, except to watch movies
- by the end of 2020, stop sending voice notes longer than 45 seconds
	- Either write or call.
	- communications become stressful: if I record long audios, obviously I need to listen to them… and they pile up. This is not good nor healthy.
- by the end of 2020, [quit Social Media](https://quitsocialmedia.club 'Quit Social Media')
- since <time datetime='2021-11-16T16:15:49+01:00'>16 November 2021</time>, do not watch more than a TV series episode a day — a.k.a. prevent binge-watching
