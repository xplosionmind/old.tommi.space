The MPC is responsible for the identification, designation and orbit computation for all of these objects. This involves maintaining the master files of observations and orbits, keeping track of the discoverer of each object, and announcing discoveries to the rest of the world via electronic circulars and an extensive website. The MPC operates at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, under the auspices of Division F of the International Astronomical Union ([IAU](https://www.iau.org/)).
- [ESA Sky](https://sky.esa.int), a Universe Map

This is really just the tip of the iceberg. Many websites, apps, and companies that offer an API provide access to the data they collect through that API.

Forward-thinking companies that may not have the resources to begin collecting their own data right away can access this publically available data and begin asking the right questions and getting answers right away.
