I will never learn Python. It requires little effort but I do not have any. I pile up potentially useful stuff about it in this note, in the vain hope I will get to it one day.

- [Handling CSVs with Python](https://dev.to/fpcorso/python-101-reading-from-and-writing-to-csv-files-in-python-2i2i 'Python 101: Reading From and Writing to CSV Files')

## Resources

- [100 page Python intro](https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/ '100 page Python intro')
- [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/ 'The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python'), python best practices guidebook, written for humans.
- [Python reference](https://github.com/rasbt/python_reference 'python-reference on GitHub'), useful functions, tutorials, and other Python-related things
