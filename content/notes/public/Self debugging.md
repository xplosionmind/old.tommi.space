title: Self-debugging
description: Debugging the self as if it was a malfunctioning software.
---
*Self debugging* consists in the process of sitting down, forgetting about everything else, and <u>debugging yourself as if you were a buggy program</u>. The aim is trying to find out what is going on at a deeper level, without ending up throwing away, repressing, or wrongly addressing the core of some personal issue.

<br>
<br>

## Steps

 1. Switch off everything, distraction included
 1. Loosen the self for a few minutes, getting ready to stay focused for a long time
 2. Pinpoint a problem, hence try to identify the source of stress or pain, define its extension and influence
 3. Start the very debugging process:
	 1. identify the source of the problem
	 2. identify its effects
	 3. imagine how would it be to live without it
	 4. think about a possible resolution
		1. Try to come up with a solution
		1. think if there may be other solutions	
		2. reflect on the applicability of those solutions
1. Take a few other minutes tinkering about the conclusion you got to and appreciate what’s been achieved. Not much has been achieved? Start a new debug

<br>
<br>

## Notes

A great [[Loops|habit]] would be to perform self debugging even when there is nothing relevant bothering or pressing us. <u>Addressing the cause of some suffering while not suffering for it</u> could open a new, brighter and helpful new perspective on a possible solution — or, to stay in the Computer Sciences vocabulary, a possible *fix*.

I <time datetime='2022-01-17T10:51:20+01:00'>just</time> found out that [Casey Watts](https://www.caseywatts.com/ 'Casey Watts’ personal website') had my same idea and wrote a book that explores my same concept: <cite>[Debugging Your Brain](https://www.debuggingyourbrain.com 'Website for “Debugging Your Brain„')</cite>. I added it to my [Books wishlist](/books#wishlist 'Books wishlist').
