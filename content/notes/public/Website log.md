description: Since I put a lot of care and attention to details in this website (probably even too much) I figured out it is worth sharing my decisions about implementations and features in a log, so that the overall design philosophy of tommi.space is summarized in one place and I can keep track of my thoughts.

## Sidenotes

Sidenotes are awesome, and after taking a look at [Koos Loijesteijn post](https://www.kooslooijesteijn.net/blog/sidenotes-without-js 'Sidenotes without JavaScript') about them, I figured it would be great to implement them on here, too.

I decided not to, for now, for three main reasons:
1. They are impossible to be implemented in Markdown, they need **a lot** of HTML and I don't have the skills for making a Jekyll plugin to transform footnotes in sidenotes (but it may be [[Website log#Sidenotes|a great idea]] to create one)
2. I could easily create an {% raw %}`{% render sidenotes.html %}`{% endraw %} where I could pass as arguments both the note content and the word linked to it, but it wouldn't satisfy me for two reasons:
	1. In the case of printing, it would be a great mess.
	2. On other readers or Markdown parsers outside of Jekyll I'd have a massive chunk of unrendered ugly text
3. Considered the reasons above, <u>it’s not worth it</u>. I use footnotes very few times (even though I massively over-use parentheses (as I am doing right now)) and with the lovely arrow[^test] automatically created, it’s painless to use them.

## Search

Notes concerning search implementation.

### Algolia

It is not the best solution in terms of speed and dependance, but it is still valid temporarily. Search functionality is very useful, so it is a trade-off I am willing to accept—temporarily).

Following [these instructions](https://www.algolia.com/doc/tools/crawler/netlify-plugin/quick-start/ 'Quickstart for Using Algolia on Netlify ') the setup is quite simple. What is annoying and long to effectively customize is [the front-end CSS](https://github.com/algolia/autocomplete/blob/next/packages/autocomplete-theme-classic/src/theme.scss 'SCSS source for Algolia’s Autocomplete front-end, on GitHub'), which I eventually decided would be simple to [write from scratch](https://github.com/xplosionmind/tommi.space/blob/main/_sass/_search.scss 'My SCSS partial for Algolia front-end styling') by myself.

## Typography and layout

Even though I love [[Typography]], I am never fully convinced about this website layout and design. My concern is not much about coloring, and typesetting, but about layouting, spacing and positioning. I am trying to understand the core of how layouting works by reading at a tremendously slow pace Richard Rutter’s <cite>[[Web Typography]]</cite>.

I will be noting below my doubts and, if solved, my conclusions.

### Questions

- Before headings, should break tags or CSS margin be used for separation between sections?
	- `<br>` spacing pros
		- effective regardless of the client and the styling
		- full control over exceptions for files
	- CSS spaging pros
		- greater flexibility for changes
		- keeping the content document more clean
- Do <q>quotes</q> from quote tags depend by the language? Which ones should I use?
