description: Removing the default operating system on my Android device and installing LineageOS.

<div class='yellow box'>
	LineageOS is unstable. I had to bargain monopoly for (still relative) “privacy” + reliability and I now own and use an iPhone 12 mini. If one day they will make a smaller <a href='https://www.fairphone.com'  target='_blank' title='Fairphone'>Fairphone</a>, I will immediately go for it and use it with the awesome <a href='https://e.foundation'  target='_blank' title='/e/'>/e/</a>

In order to remove the Google’s tracking services and obtrusive bits of proprietary code, I decided to install [LineageOS][lineage] on my [OnePlus 6T][device].   
Specifically, I installed [LineageOS for MicroG](https://lineage.microg.org 'LineageOS for MicroG'), which is a fork of LineageOS optimized to be used with [MicroG services](https://microg.org 'MicroG Project').
