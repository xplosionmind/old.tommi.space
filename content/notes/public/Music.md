One of the reasons why [[Quit Spotify|Quitting Spotify]] is so hard is that it is convenient not only from an economical point of view, but above all given the astounding availability of virtually any piece of music ever recorded. Actually, the value of music lies also in <u>looking for it</u>. The struggle of getting to actually wear your headphones and listen to what you want to is annihilated by streaming services, but probably it makes the overall value experience suffer greatly.

Probably, as [Gilad Edelman](https://www.wired.com/author/gilad-edelman/ 'Gilad Edelman’s profile on Wired') points out in <cite>[You Should Listen to CDs](https://www.wired.com/story/you-should-listen-to-cds/ 'You Should Listen to CDs')</cite>, <q cite='https://hyp.is/ONwkwGQTEeyXXMNroZdLqw/www.wired.com/story/you-should-listen-to-cds/'>Streaming platforms just aren’t designed with the serious music fan in mind</q>. The hassle of getting into a shop and looking for what you want mutates into a pleasure if you consider it as part of the experience: breathing the atmosphere of a place that is becoming one of the rarest on the planet.

While suggestions Spotify or its similars advance are [based on calculus and emotion-less considerations](/the-power-of-decentralization#algorithms-as-black-boxes '“Algorithms as Black Boxes„ section in my essay “The Power of Decentralization„'), getting into a physical place provides a matchless feeling that makes up for any annoyance. If you do not know what you intend to listen, it is not a machine providing you (feeding you with) a suggestion.
