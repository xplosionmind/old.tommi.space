I am not a developer, but I am a geek.

As a geek who admires developers and their work, I can't but share the underlying philosophy pursued by them: [the KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle 'KISS principle on Wikipedia'). Keep It Simple and Stupid.

For this reason, I always look for and pursue the simplest possible way to do things.

Most of the time, the answer is the same:\
**plain text**.

What plain text is and how does it work [I leave it to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text 'Plain text on Wikipedia'), allow me to focus on how wonderful it is.

There’s nothing much to point out, to be honest, it’s *plain clear* how cool plain text files are: why exploiting complicated, different, useless-feature packed software to achieve what can be done by using a simple text file?

- Stop creating playlists on Spotify, just copy and paste links in a plain text file.
- Stop archiving articles in Pocket or read-it-later apps: a text file with a list of links would do!
- Stop writing stuff in rich text editors, necessarily creating compatibility issues when sharing, use the lovely [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown 'Markdown on Wikipedia') instead
