[git](https://git-scm.com 'git') is arguably one of the best inventions in the history of Computer Science. It is ubiquitous, resourceful, infinite. It is one of the first thing developers (and not only them) need to master in order to be proficient and quick.

I share common people struggles when using it, but I also love it and try to exploit its potential the most I can.
