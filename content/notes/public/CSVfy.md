[CSVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values 'Comma-separated values on Wikipedia') are great. Data management for non-developers should be based on them. Unfortunately, they are not easy to be handled directly, and they are widely used only to import and export data. I will be taking notes below on how I manage my private and public data.

**Update**: [Airtable](https://airtable.com 'Airtable') is awesome and close to the perfect solution I was looking for. Nevertheless, to stick with my values I am studying and evaluating [NocoDB](https://nocodb.org 'NocoDB'), its ethical open source self-hosted alternative.
