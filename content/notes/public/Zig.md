Who I am is also, or mostly, defined by the events which marked my life even before my birth:  
*Zig* is a social network where people share dates which are significant to them. It is named in honor of [Zigmunt Bauman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigmunt_Bauman 'Zigmunt Bauman on Wikipedia'), great historian and sociologist.

A profile is made by the important milestones in both his/her life and in history in general. To put it briefly and simply, <u><cite>Zig</cite> is a <i>social medium</i> </u>

*Zig* should:
- share dates of both historical and personal events
- integrate with [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks 'ActivityPub') and therefore join the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse '“Fediverse„ on Wikipedia')
- collect other 
- integrate with [[Nolan]], and be its “public front-end”
