description: Bugs and Feature requests for the apps I use
image: https://tommi.space/bugs.svg
---
The [[Apps]] I use the most are open source and in active development. Often, I notice bugs or I have ideas of possible improvements but I rarely have time to file a proper issue for every bug or a exhaustive post for a feature request. Thus, in this list I quickly note all the thoughts which pop up in my mind, hoping some day I will have enough time to effectively share my reports.

<div class='yellow box'><h3>Note</h3>Below, I take note of improvements or bugs which were not reported by anyone else yet. If there is something I noticed but someone else opened an issue about it, I will at most comment on it, but it will not appear here. In the same way, when I address the ideas I formerly wrote on this page, I successively delete them from here.</div>

## iOS

Improvements and bugs of iOS which I notice while using my iPhone. [iPhone feedback form](https://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html 'iPhone feedback')

- **Siri offline**
- Clicking multiple times to toggle WiFi and Bluetooth: one click to disable it (white color), two clicks to completely switch it off. Alternatively, adding in the long-press pop-up the option to switch it off completely.
- More selective notifications options, as in Android: select only specific types of notifications to mute
- Extended screenshots
- Allow making downtime schedule correspond to all of the events in a calendar, e.g. for University
- **contextual volume**: automatically set the volume based on the loudness of the environment
- Repeat and shuffle controls in the player on the lock screen
- [[Digital Wellbeing implementations]]
