<div class='blue box'>Literally, I actually am the editor of myself, since I publish by my own the content I create. In this page, nevertheless, I will be referring to the word “<a href='https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/editor' target='_blank' title='“editor” in the Merriam-Webster dictionary'>editor</a>” for its cinema meaning.</div>

I have a ton of thoughts, ideas, knowledge which passes through my mind at every instant, and by editing it I mean <u>selecting what to remember, what to write down, what to focus on</u>.

Being the editor of the self means to <u class='tick'>listen to what our deepest feelings tell us</u> to do about anything we come up with. It means to be **selective**, exercising to avoid becoming too attached to impressions which in the long term are not very valuable.

As a movie editor must look at every single frame in a perspective which allows him to fit and consistently include it in the whole film, in the same way I need to plan and live every moment as only a part of my entire life, or better, as a very valuable subsection of my time on planet Earth.
