## Premise

This awesome and revolutionary tool which goes by *the Internet* is <u>so powerful that in certain ways it is becoming <strong>a threat</strong> to the freedom of its users</u>, who, in exchange for services, <u>indifferently hand over their data</u>, therefore giving up personal independence and liberty.

Essentially, I interpret internet freedom as the joint concern for two overlapping macro-themes:

- **privacy** and security of digital tools
- **decentralization** and **de-monopolization** regarding both hardware and software development

<div class='blue box'>
	I wish I had both the time and the knowledge to write some in-depth articles about the topics mentioned above, but I am still studying and trying to better tackle the problems of the internet and their roots, in order to form a well-grounded opinion. For this reason, content of this page is pretty random and schematic.

## Time

**Digital awareness is time consuming**.  
The only excuse I accept from people refusing to inform themselves about how we are being sucked into a worryingly inescapable and uncontrollable ecosystem is that <u>they don’t have time</u>.

I get it. I “wasted” hours, days, reading articles and watching videos concerning the internet, its functioning and its governance. I wish this matter could be simpler and more clear, but understanding internet monopoly both requires a fair amount of technical knowledge and it is a subtle matter.

## Choose the alternative

Just complaining, waiting for things to get better, believing that a conscious use is enough to keep clear from big tech negative impact is simply bullshit.

To change something and to make things better we need to [[Quit and switch|switch]] to healthier, more ethical, often even cooler alternatives.

![[Quit and switch]]
