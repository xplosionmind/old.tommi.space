The morning of <time datetime='2021-11-16T09:34:47+01:00'>Tuesday, November 16<sup>th</sup> at 9:35</time>, after reading a few toots suggesting that the federation of <a href='https://gitea.com' target='_blank' title='Gitea official website'>Gitea</a> instances is not relegated to a Utopian future, I decided to finally [self-host my own git forge](https://mastodon.uno/@tommi/10728603055996713 'Toot about self-hosting Gitea').

If you just want to read about [GiTMI][gitmi], please [jump to the Log](#Log 'Jump to the Log section').

## Why

First of all, why should anyone consider to move out of the great-looking, appealing and feature-packed [GitHub](https://github.com), and deciding instead to switch to any of its less diffused alternatives, or even self-host one?

- First of all, **why not**? Self-hosting an instance is [a nice experiment][rusingh-migration] to try, in my case to test skills, discover new things, and learn more about [practically working with open source][mte90-contribute-to-opensource]
- [GitHub is centralized](https://fosstodon.org/@yarmo/107263376066057557 'Toot about GitHub centralization, on Fossdon'), meaning that either you have a GitHub account or you cannot open PRs, issues, etc.
- GitHub is becoming more and more [a monopoly](), specially since its [acquisition by Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Acquisition_by_Microsoft 'â€œAcquisition by Microsoftâ€ž subsection of GitHub Wikipedia page')
- As far as I know, GitHub is made to host open source software but <u>its own source is not open</u>! This is paradoxical and comically absurd!
- This is not so relevant, but GitHub is written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org 'Rubyâ€™s official website'), while Gitea is written in [Go](https://golang.org/ 'Goâ€™s official website'); this makes Gitea rely on a more modern, faster (arguably the fastest) language and a newer framework.

## Log

A schematic log of what I am doing, setting up and maintaining [GiTMI][gitmi]

1. <time datetime='2021-11-16T08:44:40+01:00'>2021.11.16, 8:44</time> [Finding out](https://mastodon.uno/@tommi/107285620570565058 'My toot after finding out that Fedeproxy is being funded and developed') that forgesâ€™ [federation is actually going to happen](https://social.gitea.io/@gitea/107006650861897944 'Giteaâ€™s toot announcing the achievement of a first step towards federation')
2. <time datetime='2021-11-16T10:17:40+01:00'>2021.11.16, 10:17</time> Impulsively getting [gitmi.dev](https://gitmi.dev 'GiTMI') domain

### WIP

1. ðŸš§ Mirror GitHub repositories
1. ðŸš§ Migrate GitHub repositories (once federation is fully implemented)
2. [Custom CSS](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/customizing-gitea/ 'Customizing Gitea - Docs')
3. Discussions instead of issues?
