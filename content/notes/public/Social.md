- RSS / Telegram channel / bloat.io â€¦ 
- like a RSS feed, but less technical and more social
- like a Telegram channel, but not depending on Telegram (thus, it should be independent from any platform)
- like bloat.io but without having to pay
- probably Mastodon is the closest thing to my idea yet. Still, too technical.
