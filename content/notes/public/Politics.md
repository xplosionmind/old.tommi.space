### Socialism

> a movement centered on uncompromising opposition to capitalism, giving pre-eminence to the economic aspect of life, convinced that the end of capitalism will usher in an era of permanent prosperity, peace, and progress; aimed at achieving an egalitarian and brotherly society through the abolition of most or all individual ownership of property; strengthened by the certainty of possessing the truth and the key to happiness for all.

<p class='cite'>Massimo Salvadori, <cite>Modern Socialism</cite> (1968), p. 4</p>

> For many socialists, socialism was a secular faith with all the attributes of religion. As believers often do, socialists tended to live among themselves and <u>to alienate themselves from the rest of the community</u>. In nonsocialists they saw enemies with whom no reconciliation was possible, or else future converts who could be emancipated from ignorance with whom contacts took the form of missionary activities.
