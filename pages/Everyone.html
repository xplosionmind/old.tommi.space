			I had a story in his mind which I had to tell. So I wrote it, somehow I found a way to produce it, and eventually filmed it. It took several long, long months of hard work whith his friends, who where kind and crazy enough to trust and follow him in this adventure.<br />
			I actually am someone who won’t take off his pajama no matter what. Filming Everyone made me think Everyone should wake up. And love.
