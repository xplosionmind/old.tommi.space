			<h1>WARNING</h1>
			<p class="page-description">
				It is so funny to make it look like you just landed on a spam page. Do not worry, it is not (entirely). Here there is a great collection of feelings, thoughts, notes, images and various stuff by Tommi. Basically, this is the web representation of his messy mind.
				<br />
				Beware: do not get too involved with the stuff around here or you may get as crazy and confused as him, which is definitely not recommended.
				<br />
				Have fun!
